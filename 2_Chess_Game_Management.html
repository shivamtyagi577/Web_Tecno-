    <h2>Run Chess Events Online</h2>
    <p title = " ParaGraph1">Currently, chess clubs around the world are closed due to coronavirus, but even in the best of times, clubs often struggle with venue access issues and finding ways for their chess community to connect online.

Chess.com clubs provide tons of features to help you organize communities and host events online. The following guide shows you how to quickly set up and manage a club on Chess.com and how to organize online tournaments, matches, and more.</p>

    <h2 id="C1">1. Create a club.</h2>
    <p title = "Paragraph 2">Navigate to <a href="https://www.chess.com/clubs" target = "_blank">chess.com/clubs</a> and click "Create Club" in the right-hand menu.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="C2">2. Customize your club.</h2>
    <p title = "Paragragh3">Inside the club creation page, you can add a club picture and background (optional). The club picture should be your logo or another unique, easily identifiable symbol of your organization.

Next, complete the "Club Name" field. This may be the name of your club or the name of your upcoming tournament if this is for just one event. We recommend you write a short, public description of the club or tournament. Private descriptions appear to only club members and may provide additional information about upcoming club events.

Finally, if you intend to have a small group of known players participate in your club or tournament, you should turn off, "Anyone can join?" In this case, you will manually invite the players you want.

You can always revisit these settings at a later time.</p>

    <h2 id="C3">3. Invite members.</h2>
    <p>Now that your club is set up, you can begin inviting members to join. You will see the "Invite Members" option on the right-hand side of the page in the "Manage Club" section.</p>

    <h2 id="C4">4. Add admins.</h2>
    <p>Need help running the club? Create more super-admins, admins, and coordinators from the members' page. You can learn more about club administrator roles <a href="https://support.chess.com/article/336-what-are-the-different-club-roles" target = "_blank" >here</a>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="C5">5. Create news/forums.</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to communicate with all of your club members is via "News." Simply create a news article using the built-in editor to announce your online and offline events, club updates, and more! Members will be notified via a message on Chess.com.</p>
